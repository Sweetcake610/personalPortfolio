			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Welcome! I am a newly self-taught front-end developer looking to add my coding and design skills to your projects.
			Though I am new to coding I have 5+ years of work experience under my belt. I have excellent communication skills, time management,
			team building, and customer service. You won't find anyone that is more dependable, hard-working and driven to providing exceptional work in everything
			that I do.</p>
			
			<p>Please take a look around at recent projects that I have worked or working on and thank you for taking the time to visit my site!</p>
